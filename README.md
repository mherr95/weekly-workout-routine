## General Assembly - Project Two

# Overview

For Project Two, I deceided to create a RESTful API that keeps track of a users weekly workout routine

Once user enters the site, the user will be welcomed by the Fitness Week Title as well as the a collection of buttons and photos. There will be Nav Bar that will have multiple link to the other pages. The users will be able to create, edit, and delete workout routines for each day of the week.

# Technologies Used

* Languages and Frameworks - HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, Heroku, Mongoose, EJS, and Bootstrap.

# Approach
The approach I took here was a simple one. Have a main page where it introduces what the site does and then display links to pages that have different functions. Before attacking the project, I drew up a basic ouline of how I wanted the site to be structured. I then proceeded with the build.

# Features

* Create/Update/Delete workout routines
* Nav Bar linking to different webpages

# Future Improvements
