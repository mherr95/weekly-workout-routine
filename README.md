## General Assembly - Project Two

# Overview

For Project Two, I deceided to create a RESTful API that keeps track of a users weekly workout routine

Once user enters the site, the user will be welcomed by the Fitness Week Title as well as the a collection of buttons and photos. There will be Nav Bar that will have multiple link to the other pages. The users will be able to create, edit, and delete workout routines for each day of the week.

# Technologies Used

* Languages and Frameworks - HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, Heroku, Mongoose, and Bootstrap.
* Node.js is a JavaScript run time enviorment allowing the user to execute JavaScript code outside of the web.
* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the skeleton  or back bone of a website.
* Express is a framework for Node.js
* Heroku is where my app was deployed
* Mongoose allows users to create models and schemas and use MongoDB
* Boostrap is a CSS Framework that allows users to easily design their app.

# Approach
The approach I took here was a simple one. Have a main page where it introduces what the site does and then display links to pages that have different functions. Before attacking the project, I drew up a basic ouline of how I wanted the site to be structured. I then proceeded with the build.

# Unsolved Issues
During the creation of this app I ran into some issuse I coud not solve with the amount of time I was given. One main issue was separating the data from a textarea from into a list rather than one long sentence. 
Another issue I ran into was making it so that my list of days of the week would stay in order. When a day of the week was deleted and then added back it would appear at the end of the list.
